## ðŸ”Ž Open to Employment - About Me:
My experience in industry has shown me the that there is a lot of work to do. It has kindled a love for using **mathematical foundations and programming language research to arrive at elegant and powerful solutions**.
   
I love learning and developing tools that allow for simple but powerful capabilities; **Haskell and Functional programming** in general has been a great foundation to explore and develop these tools. I've written my dissertation [Modular Language Stacking](https://github.com/ErnestKz/Dissertation-ModularLanguageStacking/blob/main/Dissertation.pdf) which cites numerous articles from the very rich literature that uses Haskell to explore programming concepts.
  
I love creating tools that eases the human-computer interface. Recently I published an **Emacs** package [KeyWork](https://github.com/ErnestKz/KeyWork) which I had been personally using for a year prior to great effect.
