## ðŸ”Ž Open to Employment - About Me:
My experience in industry has shown me the that there is a lot of work to do. It has kindled a love for using **mathematical foundations and programming language research to arrive at elegant and powerful solutions**.
   
I love learning and developing tools that allow for simple but powerful capabilities; **Haskell and Functional programming** in general has been a great foundation to explore and develop these tools. I've written my dissertation [Modular Language Stacking](https://github.com/ErnestKz/Dissertation-ModularLanguageStacking/blob/main/Dissertation.pdf) which cites numerous articles from the very rich literature that uses Haskell to explore programming concepts.
   
I love using mathematical foundations to frame computer science and software problems. The value I see in **Category Theory and Type Theory** has grasped my attention, and has been propelling my reading on the topics.
  
I love creating tools that eases the human-computer interface. Recently I published an **Emacs** package [KeyWork](https://github.com/ErnestKz/KeyWork) which I had been personally using for a year prior to great effect.
  
The area of **Machine Learning** is continually captivating me, and I have been exploring how neural nets and **optimisation algorithms** behave from scratch by implementing them in the Jax automatic differentiation and hardware acceleration framework. The [Optimisation Algorithms module by Doug Leith](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Doug.Leith/CS7DS2/) that I took in my last year of college was easily my favorite, it was an extremely lively topic, taught by an extremely competent professor. I've recently been grappling with various neural net papers, namely about Transformer/Attention mechanisms.
